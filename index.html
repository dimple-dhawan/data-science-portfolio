            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a data science professional with a background in software development and a passion for solving 
                real-world problems through data. I enjoy working on projects that turn messy, unstructured information 
                into insights that support smarter decisions. Whether it’s cleaning data, writing code, or asking the 
                right questions, I like building tools that make complexity easier to understand.

            <h2>Featured Project: Cancer Risk AI</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my data science internship, I developed an AI-powered application that predicts cancer risk based on 
            user-provided information. The tool demonstrates how structured health data and patient-reported inputs can be 
            used to classify cancer risk through an interactive machine learning interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users enter health-related inputs such as age, gender, lifestyle habits, and symptoms using natural language. 
            The system translates this into structured features and uses a trained Random Forest model to classify risk 
            levels as Low, Medium, or High. The front end is built with Streamlit to provide an interactive experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this tool is based on publicly available data, it reflects the broader goal of my internship: to build 
            an intelligent assistant that helps identify patterns in patient behavior, predict potential risks, and deliver 
            insights in plain language using real-world healthcare data.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Python, R, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas</p>

            <h2>Beyond Data</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of data science, I care about focus, balance, and continuous growth. I take time to recharge through walks, 
                journaling, and quiet reflection. These habits help me stay present and think clearly, especially when solving 
                complex problems or working under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also someone who enjoys trying new things, whether it’s exploring a new restaurant, discovering local events, 
                or testing out unfamiliar tools and ideas. I like being the first to see what works and what could be better.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that staying grounded and self-aware supports clear thinking, strong collaboration, and consistent results.
