            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a data science enthusiast with a background in software development and a strong interest in how insights and 
                patterns can drive smarter decisions. I enjoy building tools that simplify complexity, whether that means writing 
                Python scripts, cleaning messy data, or asking the right questions.

            <h2>Featured Project: Cancer Risk AI</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my data science internship, I developed an AI-powered application that predicts cancer risk based on 
            user-provided information. The tool demonstrates how structured health data and patient-reported inputs can be 
            used to classify cancer risk through an interactive machine learning interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users enter health-related inputs such as age, gender, lifestyle habits, and symptoms using natural language. The system translates this into structured features and uses a trained Random Forest model to classify risk levels as Low, Medium, or High. The front end is built with Streamlit to provide an interactive experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this tool is based on publicly available data, it reflects the broader goal of my internship: to build an intelligent assistant that helps identify patterns in patient behavior, predict potential risks, and deliver insights in plain language using real-world healthcare data.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Python, R, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas</p>

            <h2>Beyond Data</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I care deeply about focus, balance, and well-being. I’ve practiced mindfulness, grounding techniques,
            and energy-based modalities like Reiki to stay calm and present—especially in fast-paced or high-pressure environments.
            These practices help me think clearly and recharge so I can stay engaged and intentional in how I work.

        <p>
            I believe that bringing both structure and self-awareness into how we approach problems leads to better solutions and stronger teams.

        <p>
            Wellness and balance have always been part of how I manage energy and maintain focus. Practices like grounding and Reiki
            support my ability to manage stress and stay present in demanding settings.

        <h3>What Keeps Me Balanced</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Walks outside</li>
            <li>Journaling</li>
            <li>Reiki</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>
            I bring self-awareness and mindfulness into how I work, collaborate, and solve problems. This helps me stay focused,
            adaptable, and aligned with my goals.
